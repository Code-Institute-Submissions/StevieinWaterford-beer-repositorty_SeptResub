# My beer repo project

## h2  This website is a hypothetical sit in off licence in Waterford . It's USP is that it stocks and serves a wide variety of beers in addition to  it doubling up as a deli . The Beer repository also runs a beer sampling course on the weekends. It's a novel idea which will hopefully educate discerning customers on  a huge range of local and imporeted artisnal beers
