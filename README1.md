# Beer Station

 This website is a hypothetical sit in off licence in Waterford . It's USP is that it stocks and serves a wide variety of continental beers. The Beer Station also runs a beer sampling course . It's a novel idea which will hopefully educate discerning customers on a huge range imported artisnal beers from Belgium and Germany.

## Features

This website is to satisfy the needs of customers in making informed decisions when choosing continental style beers. The beer station is unique to Waterford, but we feel that our customer base is knowledgeable enough and well travelled enough to satisfy their demands.

## User Needs

This website is compatible with mobile, tablet and laptops. The site itself is a basic  website which is  extremely easy to navigate. It consists of a landing page  which outlines the basic ethos of the site and when we were established, a map to locate where we are and links to social media at the bottom of the page. There are clickable links from the home page to our recommendations on the second page whic gives a brief overview of some of our top beers . The third page is a sign up page to register for  a free beer sampling.

Started with a mobile frst approach and used DEV Tools to test compatability with all devices as much as possible. I checked my HTML through the validator which threw up an issue  with a ul tag in th html , when applied I could not deltete the bullents in the u nordered list



## Bugs

In the social links colums I  coud nor delete the  bullet points in the unordered list. I tried  applting display none but this would not delete them.






## Deployment

This project is deployed using gitpod and github pages.  Github was used to write the code and seeing it is linked with github it was easy to use the terminal to commit, and push my code to their server. The deployed website is hosted on github pages.

1. Deployment was done in the following way:

2. Click on settings tab on my repository.

3. Click the pages tab.


4. Set source branch to master. This created a link to the
deployed version of the website.
