                    <p class="text">This Belgian beer is citrussy and yeasty, earthy with some mild hops with notes of
                        orange peel,candied lemon and a hint of caramilsed sugar .Its USP is surely the hopcone that
                        greets the drinker frothing from the bottle. A very welcome addition to our selection and at
                        €4:50.</p>

                    <p class="text">Pours a deep ruby black with a lasting foamy white head. Aromas of old apple,
                        jenever, wet hay, lime and lychess. The taste is medium fruity sweet with notes of old apple &
                        apricot followed by a light grainy bitterness of oats and wet hay. It doesn't come cheap at €14
                        per
                        glass what it makes up on price it delivers on quality.

                    <p class="text">Duchesse de Bourgogne boasts a gentle tartness, flavors of ripe fruit,and an
                        overal vinous quality making it a wonderfully complex drinking experience. The barrel aging
                        process impart flavors of wood and vanilla that give the beer an overall sense of structure.
                        Barrel aging also prevents
                        the fruit flavors from dominating the beer. What helps make this beer is that with all of
                        uchesse de Bourgogne’s vinous complexity, it’s remarkably accessible. Which is to say that if
                        you’ve never had a Flanders Red Ale before, this would be an excellent example to cut your teeth
                        on. A 33ml bottle of this unique rtasr sensation costs €5:40. </p>

                            biscuit aromas balanced with bittering hops and a light crispness. This lager is light and
                            refreshing, but not without fleeting complexities almost indecipherable amid extraordinary
                            balance. It is neither too sweet nor too bitter, with delicate flavors of lemongrass, floral
                            hops, and even slightly peppery notes that quickly dissipate as the 5.1 percent ABV liquid
                            refreshes the back of the palate. “Prost! to the Germans for what may be the world’s perfect
